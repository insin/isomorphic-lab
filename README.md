## Isomorphic Lab

## Note: this branch depends on changes to React Router implemented in [pull request #828](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/pull/828)

This repo is being used to experiment with writing isomorphic JavaScript apps
with [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/),
[React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) and
[express](https://github.com/strongloop/express).

It uses [newforms](https://github.com/insin/newforms) for form display and
validation on both ends - this could be done manually with any component which
can populate its form fields and display error messages based on its props and
state, though.

See [insin/newforms#55](https://github.com/insin/newforms/issues/55#issuecomment-67756422)
for discussion of implementation details.

### Common functionality

Before the top-level Handler for the current URL is rendered, the following will
be done regardless of whether or not the app is running on the client or server:

#### Data fetching ([source](https://github.com/insin/isomorphic-lab/blob/payload/src/utils/fetchData.js))

Route handlers can define a static `fetchData([params,] callback(err, data))` function,
which will be called when their route is matched against the current URL. This
can be used to asynchronously load any data required by the component up-front,
calling the callback when done.

Data will be passed as a `data` prop to the top-level Handler, with return
values from all `fetchData()` calls merged into one object.

Use JSX spread attributes to pass this all the way down the chain of route
handlers:

```javascript
<RouteHandler {...this.props}/>
```

#### Title generation ([source](https://github.com/insin/isomorphic-lab/blob/payload/src/utils/getTitle.js))

Route handlers can define a static `title` attribute or a synchronous
`getTitle(props, params)` function, which will be called when the route is
matched against the current URL.

Any props which will be passed to the top-level Handler will be passed as the
first argument to `getTitle()` - this will include a `data` prop containing any
data retrieved via the handler's own `fetchData()` function, should it need to
use it as part of the title.

Each handler should only define or return its own portion of the URL. e.g. the
top-level component might define the site name as a static `title`, while a nested
blog post component might define a static `getTitle(props)` which returns the
title of the post.

By default, these title parts will be reversed and joined with a mid-dot to form
the final title to be included in a `<title>` element or set on `document.title`
depending on the environment - this is configurable.

### Client rehydration

If `fetchData()` finds a `window.__PROPS__` variable when running on the client,
it will return the variable's value via its callback then delete the variable.

### Express middleware ([source](https://github.com/insin/isomorphic-lab/blob/payload/src/react-router-middleware.jsx))

Usage:

```
var reactRouter = require('./react-router-middleware')

app.use(reactRouter(routes[, options]))
```

#### `options.title`

An object to be passed as options to `getTitle()` - available options are:

`reverse` (`true`) - should title parts be reversed into
most-specific-first order before joining?

`join` (`' Â· '`) - string to be used to join title parts.

`defaultTitle` (`'(undefined)'`) - default title to use if none of the
matched route handlers provide title parts.

#### Response handling

In addition to performing the common functionality described above, the express
middleware handles the following scenarios:

##### Successful rendering

For a regular, successful Handler render, a `'react'` view will be rendered with the
following locals:

`title` - generated document title

`html` - rendered component output

`props` - props which were used to render the component, serialised to a JSON
string.

##### 404 rendering

If the `NotFoundRoute` is rendered at the top-level (note: this check is currently
hardcoded to check a specific route name), a `'react-404'` view will be rendered
with the following locals:

`title` - generated document title

`html` - rendered component output

##### Non-GET requests

Non-GET request bodies will be added to the `data` object received by a route
handler's static `willTransitionTo(transition, prarms, query, callback, data)`
function as a `body` property.

The request method will also be available as a `method` property.

##### Redirecting

If `transition.redirect()` is used in a `willTransitionTo()`, this will be
turned into an HTTP 303 Redirect response...

##### Re-rendering

...unless the Redirect has been given a `data` object. In this case, the
middleware will create a new Router instance for the redirect URL and the
redirect's data will be passed as props to the resulting `Handler`.

This can be used to render another route back to the user as a response, e.g.
rendering a form with user input and validation errors in response to a POST
request which contained an invalid body.

##### Errors

If an error is detected at any time, the middleware will call its `next()`
callback with the error to allow whatever error handling middleware is
configured elsewhere to pick it up.
